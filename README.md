# Life Coach App

A mindful productivity app that helps users build sustainable daily practices. Instead of overwhelming todo lists, it suggests one activity at a time based on your energy level and priorities.

## How It Works

**1. Check in with your energy**
Select morning or afternoon, then honestly rate your energy level (low, steady, or high).

**2. Get a personalized suggestion**
The app recommends an activity from your practice list that matches your current capacity — high-priority tasks when you have energy, gentler options when you don't.

**3. Start a focused session**
A minimal timer helps you stay present. Buddhist-inspired quotes appear to keep the mood calm and intentional.

**4. Track your progress**
Weekly reviews show your practice history with insights on how you've been spending your time across different priorities.
